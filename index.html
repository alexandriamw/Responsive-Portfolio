            <img class="photo" src="assets/images/self.jpg" alt="a photo of me">
            <p>Hey! Welcome to my portfolio! I'm new to this coding stuff, but an expert at the other kind of coding,
                known as medical coding. Need to know the ICD-10 code for diabetic retinopathy without macular edema?
                Look no further! E11.319. Very useful stuff there.</p>

            <p>When I'm not working, you'll usually find me hanging around in my fleece polar bear bathrobe, drinking a
                lot of coffee, and playing 30+ Words with Friends games. And I'm at level 71 on Hay Day, but I think that's
                enough embarrassing stuff for now.</p>
